# UK_ChaseOnlineBankStatement_PDF_to_CSV
If you are using Chase online banking in the UK, you could only get the PDF version of the statement with redundant details. By running this exe file, you will be able to extract the data, transaction name, amount and balance and use them in a CSV file./n
/n
To use this, you will need to create the folder structure as follows/n
D:\Chase Bank Statement\Active -- This is where you put the pdf file downloaded from the app/n
D:\Chase Bank Statement\Output -- This is where you get the CSV output/n
D:\Chase Bank Statement\Prcessed Raw PDF -- This is where the pdf file you put in the active folder will go after processing/n
/n
After setting up the above, you could put the PDF file in the active folder and run the exe and check on the CSV version of the Bank Statement!/n

/n
This is a side project for my leisure, not meant to be super useful to everyone./n
I built this with Python but considered that not everyone will have the Python environment, I have output the code as exe. So that you could simply set up the folder structure and run the exe then you are good to go./n
/n
***So far, this could only process one file each time. If you have multiple files, you will need to put one file in the active folder each time you are running the exe.

Feel free to tell me how this could be better!/n
